	Kismet events needed:
		- [N/A] selected item changed (wouldn't be necessary if sequence events were propagated up the parent chain)
		- [N/A] user typed into the editbox (handled by editbox?) (wouldn't be necessary if sequence events were propagated up the parent chain)
			- event propagation is now enabled....make compatible.

	General todo:
		- implement the CaptionRenderComponent.
		- Also, if we have a CaptionRenderComponent, need to adjust the region available for rendering the editbox/button so that we have room to render the caption.
		- refactor UIComp_DrawString to not assume that the entire bounds of the owning widget should be considered the "adjustable region" when the component is configured
			to autosize itself.

		- should we add a data store binding property for the combo's background image component?

		- [N/A (as long as we don't support instant update of the editbox text)] if the list loses focus, restore the editbox's text to the previous item
