/**
 * Abstract base class for UI events.
 * A UIEvent is some event that a widget can respond to.  It could be an input event such as a button press, or a system
 * event such as receiving data from a remote system.  UIEvents are generally not bound to a particular type of widget;
 * programmers choose which events are available to widgets, and artists decide which events to implement.
 *
 * Features:
 *	Able to execute multiple actions when the event is called.
 *	Able to operate on multiple widgets simultaneously.
