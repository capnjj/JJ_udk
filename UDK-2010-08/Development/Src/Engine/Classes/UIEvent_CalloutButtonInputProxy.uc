/**
 * This specialized UIEvent class serves as a container for the input keys associated with the UICalloutButtons contained
 * in a scene.  It is automatically added and removed from the scene's sequence based on whether the scene contains
 * a UICalloutButtonPanel object; it is never added by a designer and isn't visible in the UI editor's list of available
 * sequence events.
 *
 * The output links of this event are dictated by the input aliases assigned to the UICalloutButtons contained within the
 * scene.  Each UICalloutButton in the scene will be represented by an output link which is only activated by the input key
 * associated with that button.
 *
 * There are two ways for users to add output links to instances of this event class.
 * Designers can add output links to this event directly.  Doing so causes a new UICalloutButton to be automatically
 * inserted into the callout panel and assigned whichever alias is associated with the input key used to create the new
 * output link.
 * Alternately (and likely the more common case), when a designer adds a new callout button to a UICalloutButtonPanel,
 * an output link is created in this event object for the input key associated with that callout button's input alias.
