 *	- need support for specifying "input alias => raw input key" mappings for widget archetypes (UIInputAliasStateMap/UIInputAliasClassMap/UIInputConfiguration)
 *	- [FIXED?] reformatting doesn't occur for instanced UIList widgets or widgets which have UIComp_DrawString components (either when placing or updating).
 *	- [FIXED] modifying docking relationships using the docking editor doesn't propagate changes to instances.
 *	- [FIXED] most changes made through kismet editor (adding new seq. objects, removing objects, etc.) aren't propagated to instances at all
