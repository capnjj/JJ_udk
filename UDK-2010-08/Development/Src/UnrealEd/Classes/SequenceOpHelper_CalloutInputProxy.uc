/**
 * This class is used to provide the editor with a way to apply specialized logic specific to the UIEvent_CalloutButtonProxy
 * class without requiring the editor to know anything about that class.  It is invoked by the kismet editor when the user
 * double-clicks or right-clicks on a UIEvent_CalloutButtonInputProxy object.  It instantiates a customized version of the
 * respective context menus which has additional logic for dealing with UIEvent_CalloutButtonInputProxy objects.
