<h1 > Scaleform CLIK API Documentation </h1>

<p >
 &nbsp;</p>
<p >
This API documentation provides information on the<strong> Scaleform® Common Lightweight Interface Kit (CLIK™)</strong> framework and the ActionScript 2.0 classes that it is composed of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CLIK framework is designed to help quickly prototype user interfaces and take them to completion through all phases of the production pipeline. It consists of several core classes for basic component types, component management and inter- and intra- component communication. These classes form the foundation of CLIK, and are used by the set of prebuilt components that are distributed with this kit.&nbsp;</p>

<p >
CLIK is distributed with several prebuilt interface elements that can be easily skinned and customized to create interfaces in multimedia applications that use Scaleform GFx. These components range from basic types such as buttons and checkboxes, to complex components such as list boxes, drop down menus and modal dialog boxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
These CLIK Help pages describe the methods and properties of the core classes and are classified under the following sections:&nbsp;</p>
<p >
• <i>gfx.controls</i> - contains classes used by standard controls such as the Button component.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
• <i>gfx.core</i> - contains base classes used by all CLIK components.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
• <i>gfx.data</i> - contains the concrete classes that provide data to components.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
• <i> gfx.events</i> - contains classes used by the CLIK framework’s event model.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
• <i>gfx.interfaces</i> - contains interfaces used by CLIK elements. These interfaces are not implemented directly and are provided only for reference.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
• <i>gfx.io</i> - contains classes used to communicate with the operating game engine or operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
• <i> gfx.managers</i> – contains entities that manage focus, input, pop-ups, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
• <i>gfx.motion</i> - contains tweening and animation specific utilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
• <i>gfx.ui</i> -contains miscellaneous classes used by CLIK managers and the event model.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
• <i>gfx.utils</i> - contains general purpose utility classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
